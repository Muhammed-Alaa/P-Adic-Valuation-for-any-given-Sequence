# P-Adic-Valuation-for-any-given-Sequence
This is a python code for calculating P-Adic valuation for any given Sequence like Fibonacci, Bell, â€¦ etc. and for any adic value, (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.)
Also P-Adic valuation is so important tool to analyse sequences and for number theory overall, you can know more about it through here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_order

It is so essential before solving any (Diophantine Equation) for any sequence, having the pattern of the P-Adic valuation and analysing it and see the mod functions and the dependency will reveal more information about this sequence.
